# Book-Marker
**This is my Object Library project from TOP**

In this project I'll have to create a library app that can:

- [x] Show some related info from each book
- [x] Mark them as read 
- [x] Remove them from the app
- [x] Add new books with a form

To acomplish that I'll have to:

- [x] Have an array of objects, where each object represent a book
- [x] Create a function that display the books on a table on page load and on any update
- [x] Each object must have a flag for read status
- [x] Create a function that change the read status
- [x] Create a function that removes the selected book from the array
- [x] Create a constructor function ~~to push the books into the array~~ for any new book
- [x] Create a function to push the books into the array

Some extra features:

- [x] Add a time stamp for when the books were added to the table which will serve as an **id** for each book
- [x] The option to sort the table for each property in ascendent or descendent order
- [x] The option to filter only the read or unread books
- [ ] *Use localStorage to save options object and booksArray*
