# Book-Marker
**This is my Object Library project from TOP**

In this project I'll have to create a library app that can:

- [ ] Show some related info from each book
- [ ] Mark them as read 
- [ ] Remove them from the app
- [ ] Add new books with a form

To acomplish that I'll have to:

- [ ] Have an array of objects, where each object represent a book
- [ ] Create a function that display the books on a table on page load and on any update
- [ ] Each object must have a flag for read status
- [ ] Create a function that change the read status
- [ ] Create a function that removes the selected book from the array
- [ ] Create a constructor function to push the books into the array

Some extra features:

- [ ] Add a time stamp for when the books were added to the table which will serve as an **id** for each book
- [ ] The option to sort the table for each property in ascendent or descendent order
- [ ] The option to filter only the read or unread books
